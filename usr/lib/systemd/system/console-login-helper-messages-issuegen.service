[Service]
Type=oneshot
# This service expects to be started repeatedly after exiting (whenever a new
# runtime issue snippet is dropped into the directory watched by
# `console-login-helper-messages-issuegen.path`). `RemainAfterExit` is thus
# explicitly set to `no`, so that the service can re-execute (otherwise,
# `start` on this service after it has exited once before does not have any
# effect).
RemainAfterExit=no
ExecStart=/usr/libexec/console-login-helper-messages/issuegen
